# SphereRunAR

Sphere Run AR is an augmented reality (AR) single player mobile application that allows the user to control a sphere/player as you dodge and avoid obstacles.
The project was conceived during a 3 day hackathon. A solo project, it was my first attempt at programming outside of Javascript. I used Unity for basic game play and integrated 8th Wall XR for the augmented reality aspect. The programming scripts were all written in C#, the language of Unity.
